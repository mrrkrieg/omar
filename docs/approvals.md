# Approval monitoring in Omar's web UI

Approval requests are independent of execution status. A blocked agent shows an
orange dot with **Waiting for approval**, while other agents retain their running
state. The web header counts pending requests; clicking it opens the request and
selects its invocation when the corresponding topology is displayed. The executive
assistant has an indicator in its chat header even before a topology exists.

The review panel shows the action, tool, scope and elapsed waiting time. **Open
agent terminal** opens the same agent session where the backend can accept the
operator's response. Opening or closing the panel/terminal never resolves a request.
Inline Allow/Deny actions are intentionally absent until an integration supports
them end to end.

## Supported sessions

The initial observer supports Codex sessions attached to the per-pane app-server
that Omar provisions. It subscribes to the one loaded thread without overriding
the session's model, permissions or approval policy. Commands, file changes,
additional permissions, MCP elicitations and MCP tool approval questions provide
structured signals. Ordinary questions and silence do not.

An explicit backend `waitingOnApproval` flag can provide a generic request when
detailed replay is unavailable. Such a request directs the operator to the
terminal for the exact scope; its timer starts when Omar detects it. Detailed
requests use the backend's timestamp where available. MCP approval questions are
recognized by the backend's `mcp_tool_call_approval_` question marker.

If the backend supports status reads but rejects history/resume, Omar keeps
polling the explicit approval flag. Full details and MCP questions that are only
classified as general user input may be unavailable on those builds; the
observer does not guess their meaning from inactivity or terminal text.

Other backends, older versions without these APIs, command wrappers that prevent
attachment, and ambiguous panes with multiple loaded threads cannot provide full
monitoring. The API reports connection availability independently; the assistant
header offers terminal access when monitoring is unavailable. This feature does
not change how agents are launched or relax their permissions.

## Adding a backend

`ApprovalHub` owns shared request identity, invocation correlation, timestamps,
connection state and bounded retention. `ApprovalObserver` receives an
`ApprovalSink` for publishing display metadata and lifecycle updates; it owns
transport discovery, parsing, deduplication and authoritative reconciliation.
It must not submit approval decisions or change backend permissions.

`src/approvals/backends/mod.rs` is the capability registry. Currently it registers
only Codex. To add Claude Code or another backend, implement `ApprovalObserver`
in that directory and register its factory. Neither the hub nor the runtime/UI
call sites need another backend-specific branch. Codex socket discovery,
WebSocket JSON-RPC and protocol fixtures live in `backends/codex.rs`.

Both topology agents and the executive assistant select from this registry using
their actual backend identity. Unsupported backends report `unsupported`
immediately and do not start a Codex monitor. Existing unattended launch defaults
(e.g. Claude/Antigravity skip-permissions and Cursor yolo) remain unchanged;
lack of notification support never overrides an operator's permission settings.

## Lifecycle and wire protocol

`GET /v1/approvals` returns an `ApprovalSnapshot`. `GET /v1/approvals/events`
streams complete snapshots as SSE `approvals` events, including an initial
snapshot on every connection. Wire types are generated from Rust alongside the
rest of the UI protocol. Requests are scoped to an agent, run and invocation;
the assistant has no run or invocation requirement.

Reloading the page preserves pending requests in the daemon. Disconnects retain
them and show **Connection lost**. Reconnection replays backend requests and
reconciles authoritative thread state. Acknowledgements resolve requests; a bare
acknowledgement is never described as approval or successful completion. Explicit
declined item status is recorded as denial; run teardown cancels remaining requests.
The recent resolution list is bounded. Daemon restart persistence is not provided;
live supported sessions are rediscovered and pending requests replayed.

Only bounded display metadata is published. Private reasoning, tool results and
arbitrary argument objects are excluded. Obvious credential-bearing commands and
explanations are hidden; the terminal remains the authoritative full review view.
